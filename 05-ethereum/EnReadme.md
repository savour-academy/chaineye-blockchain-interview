### 1. Explain in detail the process of packaging Ethereum transactions
Ethereum is a blockchain network that allows users to send and receive ether (ETH) and other tokens and execute smart contracts on the chain. These transactions need to be packaged into blocks and verified and confirmed by miners.

The following is a detailed description of the process of packaging Ethereum transactions:

Create Transaction: A transaction is created and signed by the sender. It includes the sender's Ethereum address, the receiver's Ethereum address, the transaction amount, and some optional transaction data.

Broadcast transactions: Transactions need to be broadcast to all nodes on the network. This works by sending the transaction to a node, which then broadcasts it to other nodes it knows about.

Transaction pool: After transactions are broadcast, they will enter the pending transaction pool. In the transaction pool, transactions wait to be included in new blocks.

Packing transactions: Miners will select some transactions from the transaction pool and package them into new blocks. Miners usually choose transactions with the highest gas fees because they can receive higher rewards from them. Once miners have packed transactions into blocks, they are considered confirmed and executed.

Confirmed Transactions: Once a new block is created and added to the blockchain containing new transactions, those transactions are considered confirmed and executed.

Transaction fee: Transaction fee is paid by the sender and is calculated by consuming a certain amount of gas. Gas is a unit of measurement in the Ethereum network used to measure the computing resources required to execute transactions. Miners receive these transaction fees as a reward to encourage them to participate in the process of packaging transactions.

In short, the process of Ethereum transaction packaging involves creating transactions, broadcasting transactions, transaction pools, packaging transactions, confirming transactions, and transaction fees. This process is automated and performed by nodes and miners in the blockchain network.

### 2. Why does Ethereum fork? When encountering a forked wallet, how should layer2 similar applications be handled?
### 3. What is the data structure used at the bottom of Ethereum? Can you explain it in detail?
Ethereum uses a variety of different data structures at the bottom, the most important of which are the Merkle Patricia Tree and the state database.

Merkle Patricia Tree is an efficient data structure used to store and manage the state of Ethereum accounts and transactions. It is a tree structure where each node contains a hash value and a key-value pair. Key-value pairs are used to store account addresses, transaction hashes and other information, while hash values ​​are used to quickly verify the integrity and consistency of data. Merkle Patricia Tree is widely used in Ethereum's account status tree and transaction status tree.

Another important data structure is the state database. It is the global state storage of Ethereum, including information such as balances, codes, storage and contract status of all accounts. The implementation of the state database is based on LevelDB, which can store and retrieve state data efficiently.

In addition to this, Ethereum also uses other data structures, such as Bloom Filter and B-Tree, to optimize the performance and efficiency of the blockchain. Bloom Filter is used to quickly retrieve whether an element exists in a certain collection, while B-Tree is a self-balancing tree commonly used in database indexes.

### 6. Do you understand EIP155 of Ethereum? What problems does it mainly exist to solve?
### 7. Do you know Eip712 of Ethereum? What problems does it mainly exist to solve?
EIP712 is a standard on Ethereum that defines a message structure and signing method for secure message verification and authorization in decentralized applications (DApps).

Specifically, EIP712 allows DApps to verify user authorization for certain operations without revealing private keys. It ensures message integrity and authentication, as well as preventing replay attacks and other fraud by using predefined message formats and signature methods.

Another important use of EIP712 is to enable DApps to interact with smart contracts more securely and directly. By using the message format defined by the EIP712 standard, smart contracts can verify messages from DApps, thereby protecting the contract from fraudulent attacks.

In summary, EIP712 provides a secure and standardized message verification and authorization method for DApps and smart contracts in the Ethereum ecosystem.

### 9. Briefly explain the underlying operating mechanism of Ethereum’s EVM
Ethereum's EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is one of the core components of the Ethereum network. It is a stack-based virtual machine that provides a running environment for smart contracts. The following is a brief description of the underlying operating mechanism of EVM:

1. Instruction set: EVM adopts a streamlined instruction set, including arithmetic operations, comparison operations, logical operations, memory operations, stack operations, etc. Each instruction has an opcode and some operands. When the instruction is executed, the EVM reads the opcode from the instruction set and operates according to the operands.

2. Stack: The operation of EVM is based on stack. There is a stack in EVM, and all operands are pushed into the stack instead of using registers. The size of the stack is fixed and cannot be adjusted, so smart contracts need to be written according to the size of the stack.

3. Storage: There is also a memory in the EVM in which data can be stored. The memory is allocated by word (32 bytes). The memory is accessible via the contract's address and memory index, and each memory cell has an initial value of zero.

4. Memory: EVM also has a memory area that can be used to store temporary data. The instructions in the EVM can read and write data in the memory, but the size of the memory is dynamically adjusted, and the size is increased by 32 bytes each time.

5. State transition: When a smart contract is called, the EVM will load its code into memory and execute it one by one according to the instructions. When an instruction is executed, the EVM changes the state of the contract, such as changing the value in memory, pushing data onto the stack, etc. Once the smart contract is executed, the EVM saves the final state to the Ethereum blockchain.

### 10.What is the implementation principle of EVM memory?
EVM (Ethereum Virtual Machine) is a virtual machine on the Ethereum blockchain that is used to execute the code of smart contracts. In the EVM, memory is a byte array used to store temporary data while executing smart contracts.

The implementation principle of EVM memory is as follows:

Memory is a memory space composed of byte arrays. In EVM, memory size is in bytes, with a maximum size of 2^256 bytes.

The memory is stored permanently, which means it can be accessed during the life cycle of the smart contract.

Each byte of memory has a unique index value called a memory address. The memory address is an Ethereum address ranging from 0 to 2^256-1.

Smart contracts can access data in memory through memory addresses. The memory address can be used directly in the code of the smart contract or passed through function parameters.

Memory read and write operations are expensive operations, so memory usage should be minimized in smart contracts.

Read operations from memory are free, but write operations require gas. The gas cost of a write operation depends on the number of bytes written.

In short, EVM memory is a memory space composed of byte arrays used to store temporary data when executing smart contracts. The memory address uniquely identifies each byte in the memory, and smart contracts can access the data in the memory through the memory address. Memory usage should be minimized in smart contracts because both read and write operations are expensive operations.

### 11. Briefly explain the block packaging mechanism of Ethereum nodes
In the Ethereum network, each block contains a set of transactions, which can be ordinary transactions or smart contract calls. When a node mines a new block on the Ethereum network, it needs to perform the following steps to package the transaction:

Select a group of transactions to be packaged from the transaction pool, and usually the transactions with the highest transaction fees are selected first for packaging.

These transactions are sorted according to certain rules to ensure that each node has the same transaction order, thereby ensuring that all nodes reach consensus.

Calculate the hash value of the block header and write it into the new block together with the transaction data.

New blocks are broadcast to the entire network for other nodes to verify and confirm.

In Ethereum, smart contracts are written in high-level programming languages ​​like Solidity and run through the EVM. When a smart contract is called, the EVM will execute the contract code and write the results to the blockchain. Smart contract calls can also be packaged into blocks as a transaction.

### 12. What is the calculation mechanism of Ethereum’s block header?
Ethereum's block header calculation mechanism is a hash-based mechanism, which consists of the following parts:

Parent block hash: points to the hash value of the previous block in the chain where the current block is located, used to ensure the non-tamperability of the blockchain.

Status root hash: represents the root hash of the status of all accounts in the current block, used to ensure the legitimacy of all transactions that occur in the current block.

Transaction root hash: represents the hash value of the hash tree root node of all transactions in the current block, used to verify the validity of all transactions in the block.

Timestamp: Specifies the creation timestamp of the block, which is used to verify the timing of the block.

Difficulty target value: an integer that limits the hash value of the current block to be less than this value to ensure that the proof of work of the current block complies with network rules.

These components will be integrated together and calculated through a hash function to produce a 32-byte block header hash value, which is used to uniquely identify the block. Every node on the blockchain can use this hash to verify the validity of the block and add it to the blockchain.

### 16. Let’s talk about Ethereum’s Bloom filter in detail
Bloom Filter in Ethereum is a data structure used to quickly retrieve data. It is often used in state transition data storage (State Trie) in Ethereum to improve the efficiency of state queries.

A Bloom filter consists of a bit array and a set of hash functions. The length of the bit array is fixed, usually several million to tens of millions of bits. The hash function maps the input to a position on the bit array and sets the value of that position to 1. When querying for an element, the element is input into the hash function. If the positions corresponding to all hash functions are 1, the element may be in the data set; otherwise, the element must not be in the data set.

Ethereum's bloom filter is used to record whether a transaction address has been used before. In a block, each transaction contains a sender address and a receiver address. When a block is processed, the addresses of all transactions are added to the bloom filter. When you need to query whether an address has been used in the future, you only need to input the address into the Bloom filter. If the positions corresponding to all hash functions are 1, the address may have been used; otherwise, the address The address must not have been used before.

The advantage of the Bloom filter is that it can quickly determine whether an element is in the data set without traversing the entire data set. However, due to the existence of hash functions, Bloom filters have a certain false positive rate. If an element is misjudged to be in the data set, it may cause unnecessary queries and reduce system performance. Therefore, when using Bloom filters, it is necessary to weigh the relationship between false positive rate and performance and choose appropriate parameter configuration.

### 17. How to prevent misjudgments of Bloom filters
The misjudgment of Bloom filter is caused by the collision caused by the hash function. Therefore, in order to reduce the possibility of misjudgment, the following methods can be adopted:

Increase the number of hash functions: Increasing the number of hash functions can reduce the probability of collisions, thereby reducing the possibility of misjudgment.

Increase the size of the bloom filter: Increasing the size of the bloom filter allows it to accommodate more elements, thereby reducing the possibility of false positives.

Adjust the parameters of the Bloom filter: You can adjust the parameters of the Bloom filter according to the specific situation, such as the type of hash function, the size of the Bloom filter, etc.

Combining multiple bloom filters: Multiple bloom filters can be combined to further reduce the possibility of false positives.

Combine with other data structures: Bloom filters can be combined with other data structures such as red-black trees, hash tables, etc. to improve accuracy.

### 18. Let’s talk about the ETH Casper FFG consensus mechanism in detail
The Ethereum Casper FFG (Friendly Finality Gadget) consensus mechanism is a hybrid consensus mechanism upgraded from Ethereum 2.0. It combines the advantages of Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Work (PoW) algorithms and aims to improve the security, scalability and decentralization of the network.

In Casper FFG, verification nodes need to lock a certain amount of Ethereum (ETH) as collateral to be eligible to participate in bookkeeping. These verification nodes are called validators, and their task is to verify transactions and package blocks. Unlike pure PoS, Casper FFG still requires PoW miners to produce blocks, but they no longer directly generate new ether coins, but receive transaction fees as rewards.

Casper FFG introduces a concept called "bonded validator voting". Validators can choose to vote on a block to indicate whether they approve of it. If more than 2/3 of the stake (i.e. the amount of staked ether) supports a block, then the block is considered final and the transaction is determined to be irreversible. This is the so-called "finality", which is an important feature of the PoS algorithm and can ensure the security of the network.

Casper FFG also introduces a concept called a "punitive mechanism". If a validator performs poorly or acts intentionally evil, they may lose their staked ether, which is known as "slashing." If a validator votes for two Conflicting blocks will also be punished. This penalty mechanism can effectively prevent misbehavior of validators and maintain the security and stability of the network.

Overall, Casper FFG aims to improve the security and scalability of the Ethereum network while maintaining its decentralized nature.

### 19. What do the epoch and slot of the beacon chain represent respectively, and how many slots does an epoch contain?
The beacon chain is a major chain in Ethereum 2.0, which adopts the PoS consensus mechanism. In the beacon chain, time is divided into a series of epochs and slots.

An epoch refers to a period of time, which consists of a certain number of slots. In the beacon chain, each epoch lasts 6.4 minutes and each slot lasts 12 seconds. Therefore, an epoch contains 32 slots.

In the beacon chain, each slot is composed of a validator, and the validator needs to perform verification work and package blocks in each slot. Over time, validators will take turns participating in different slots to ensure the security and decentralization of the network.

By dividing time into epochs and slots, the beacon chain can achieve a more efficient consensus mechanism and also facilitate validators to take turns to verify.

### 20. In what state is the beacon chain block irreversible?
In the beacon chain, a block is considered irreversible when the following conditions are met:

Blocks must be fully confirmed: A block is considered fully confirmed when the voting results of all validators on the block have been recorded on the chain, and more than 2/3 of the validators in the voting results have confirmed the block.

Blocks must be in a finality epoch: a finality epoch is a confirmed epoch in which every slot has been voted for and at least 2/3 of the validators participated in the voting. Only blocks in finality epochs are considered irreversible because they have received sufficient confirmations and support.

Therefore, a block containing a fully confirmed block is only irreversible in an epoch in which finality voting has been completed. In this case, the block is considered the final state on the blockchain and transactions within it cannot be changed or reversed.

### 21. How to calculate the attack cost of the beacon chain
Recovering a finalized block requires at least 1/3 of the validators to burn their deposits. Calculate the attack cost according to this formula: Attack cost: 1/3 * (number of validators * 32) * ETH/USDT structure

### 22. For wallets and layer2 applications, how to set the security height of beacon chain deposits and withdrawals more appropriately?
### 23. Briefly describe the role of EIP-3651
Speaking of EIP-3651, we must first introduce a change in EIP-2929: when the target is not in accessed_addresses, charge COLD_ACCOUNT_ACCESS_COST (cold account access cost) gas and add the address to accessed_addresses. Otherwise, WARM_STORAGE_READ_COST (warm storage read cost) gas is charged, and warm read gas consumption is relatively low.

Nowadays, COINBASE direct payment is becoming more and more popular, but the current price of accessing COINBASE is higher; this is due to the fact that under the access list framework introduced by EIP-2929, COINBASE calculates gas according to the cold account access cost. In EIP- 3651 Afterwards, accessed_addresses will include the address returned by COINBASE (0x41).

Benefit: After modification, COINBASE will reduce gas consumption when paying ERC20 tokens.

### 24. Briefly describe the role of EIP-3855
EIP-3855, introduces a new instruction (0x5f) to push the constant value 0 onto the stack. The instruction set for PUSH in the Yellow Book currently only has PUSH1-PUSH32, which is used to push 1 byte onto the stack and 32 bytes onto the stack.

The existing instruction implementation pushes the 0 value onto the stack by executing PUSH1 0 , which costs 3 gas in the runtime and an additional 200 gas (2 bytes of storage cost)

With the PUSH0 instruction, there is no need to consume this additional 200 gas.

Benefits: Currently, about 11% of PUSH operations just push 0, so this EIP can save a certain amount of gas after execution, and can also slightly improve the existing TPS of Ethereum.

### 25. Briefly describe the role of EIP-3860
The current maximum initcode is MAX_CODE_SIZE: 24576 (EIP-170), and the new initcode's maximum is (MAX_INITCODE_SIZE = 2 * MAX_CODE_SIZE = 49152), which means that the contract size can be doubled, and contract developers can deploy richer functions. (Excessive contract code will lead to unsuccessful deployment. PS: The L2 project has also been partially modified to support a higher contract size limit)

In addition, a 2 gas fee is introduced for each 32-byte initcode chunk to represent the cost of jumpdest-analysis. Because during contract creation, the client must perform jumpdest analysis on the initcode before execution. Execution work scales linearly with the size of the initcode.

This means that initcode will cost 0.0625 gas per byte, and the contract deployment gas cost will increase slightly.

Benefits: The gas fee for contract deployment is slightly increased, but the contract size can be doubled, allowing contract developers to write richer functional codes.

### 26. Briefly describe the role of EIP-4895
The main content is to determine the main process of withdrawing money from the beacon chain to EVM. After the deployment is completed, the Ethereum beacon chain pledge withdrawal function will be activated.

Benefits: Activate the Ethereum Beacon Chain pledge withdrawal function.

### 27. Explanation of Ethereum’s state tree, transaction tree, block tree and storage tree
The state tree is one of the most important data structures in Ethereum. It is used to store the status of all accounts in the Ethereum network. Each Ethereum account has a corresponding status entry, which includes information such as account address, balance, code and storage data. The state tree is a Merkle-Patricia tree that stores all account states in the leaf nodes of the tree. Each leaf node contains a hash value of the account status, which is calculated from the account's address and other status data. Through the status tree, the Ethereum network can quickly verify whether the status of an account is legal.

State Trie: The state tree is one of the most important data structures in Ethereum. It is used to store the status of all accounts in the Ethereum network. Each Ethereum account has a corresponding status entry, which includes information such as account address, balance, code and storage data. The state tree is a Merkle-Patricia tree that stores all account states in the leaf nodes of the tree. Each leaf node contains a hash value of the account status, which is calculated from the account's address and other status data. Through the status tree, the Ethereum network can quickly verify whether the status of an account is legal. , the entire state tree is constructed by hashing calculations on each account's nonce (used to prevent transaction replay), balance, contract code and other information.

Transaction Trie: A Merkle tree structure used to store all transactions. Each leaf node represents the hash value of a transaction, and each parent node represents the hash value of the hash values ​​of the two child nodes below it. This tree structure can be used to verify whether a transaction exists in a certain block and to verify the correctness of the transaction.

Block Trie: It is also a Merkle Patricia tree, used to store the hash values ​​of all blocks. Each leaf node represents the hash value of a block, and each parent node represents the hash value of the hashes of the two child nodes below it. This tree structure can be used to verify whether the block is valid and whether it belongs to the main chain of Ethereum.

Storage Trie: used to store data in Ethereum contracts, including variables, mappings, arrays, etc. The storage tree is a Merkle Patricia tree, with each node representing a key-value pair. This tree structure can be used to verify the correctness and integrity of contract data.
